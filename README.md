## Hi there 👋

👋 Hello, I'm Mubashir!

I'm a passionate software developer and computer science student with a strong interest in programming, problem-solving, and building practical applications. My learning journey revolves around understanding core programming concepts, object-oriented design, and modern development tools.

🔍 What I'm Focused On:
- Programming Fundamentals: C++, Python, and C# with strong OOP concepts  
- Python Development: Streamlit apps, quizzes, and utility tools  
- Web & Docs Platforms: Docusaurus-based documentation websites  
- Problem Solving: Logical thinking, algorithms, and clean code practices  

🌱 Currently Learning:
- Advanced Object-Oriented Programming (Python & C#)  
- Streamlit web app enhancements (timers, progress bars, reports)  
- Digital Logic Design & Computer Architecture concepts  
- Building structured educational and documentation projects  

🤝 Let's Collaborate:
I'm always open to collaborating with learners, developers, and educators. If you're working on an educational platform, coding project, or documentation site, I’d love to contribute!

I’m interested in working on:
- Educational & learning-based applications  
- Python & C# projects  
- Documentation websites (Docusaurus)  
- Beginner-friendly coding tools
